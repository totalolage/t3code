# Running T3 Code in the Background

On a Linux host, T3 Code can run as a background service for your user. It starts when the machine
boots and keeps running after you log out.

## Manage the Service

Install it with the latest T3 Code release:

```sh
npx t3@latest service install
```

Check whether it is installed:

```sh
npx t3@latest service status
```

Update or repair it:

```sh
npx t3@latest service update
```

Stop it and remove it from startup:

```sh
npx t3@latest service uninstall
```

Updating restarts T3 Code briefly. Let active agent work and terminal commands finish first.

For a classic s6 scan directory, pass the same supervisor options to each lifecycle command:

```sh
sudo t3 service install --base-dir "$HOME/.t3" \
  --supervisor s6 --service-dir /run/service/t3code
sudo t3 service status --base-dir "$HOME/.t3" \
  --supervisor s6 --service-dir /run/service/t3code
```

The service directory must already be inside a scan directory managed by `s6-svscan`. T3 Code owns
the `run` file inside that directory and controls it with `s6-svc`. The generated service drops
privileges before starting T3 Code. A non-root invocation uses its own UID and GID; a root invocation
under `sudo` uses `SUDO_UID` and `SUDO_GID`. For another account, or when invoking directly as root,
select the non-root identity explicitly and repeat it for update or repair commands:

```sh
t3 service install --supervisor s6 --service-dir /run/service/t3code \
  --service-user t3 --service-group t3
```

Installation reconciles the T3 Code state and log ownership to the selected identity so the service
can keep writing across supervisor restarts.

Pass `--host` and `--port` when the managed service needs a stable listening address. These values
are persisted in the generated service definition:

```sh
t3 service install --supervisor s6 --service-dir /run/service/t3code \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3773
```

## Automatic Service Updates

Set **Settings** → **General** → **Service update repository** to an exact GitHub repository URL,
such as `https://github.com/owner/repository`. Leave it empty to disable automatic service updates.

Every 15 minutes the managed service checks that repository's GitHub releases. A newer
platform-specific CLI and its adjacent `.sha256` file are downloaded into the T3 Code runtime
directory. T3 Code verifies the checksum and the binary's reported version before marking the
update pending.

While an update is pending, existing agent turns may finish and new turns are saved in a durable
queue. Once no agent turn is active, T3 Code atomically replaces the systemd unit or s6 launcher and
asks the configured supervisor to restart it. The replacement process invokes queued turns after it
starts. A failed supervisor activation restores the previous service definition and resumes queued
work.

For s6, the root-owned run script remains fixed. It grants the selected group permission to restart
only that service, drops privileges, and then runs a launcher under the selected identity. Automatic
updates replace that user-owned launcher rather than modifying a script that s6 executes as root.

The systemd unit runs a small stable launcher. Exact T3 Code versions are installed separately, so
a failed remote candidate can return to the previous version without rewriting the unit. Releases
that change the database must be installed with the local `service update` command above.

## Using It with T3 Connect

T3 Connect may offer to install the service during setup so the host stays reachable after you log
out. This is only an onboarding shortcut: the service and T3 Connect are managed separately.

Signing out of T3 Connect does not remove the service. Use `t3 service uninstall` when you no longer
want T3 Code to start in the background.

The background service requires Linux with either a systemd user manager or a classic s6 scan
directory.
